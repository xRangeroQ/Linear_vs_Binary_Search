## 📌 Overview
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a **sorted array**. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the search space in each step.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** $O(\log n)$
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (Iterative)
- **Requirement:** The input array **must be sorted**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Optimized:** Iterative approach for memory efficiency.
- **Readable:** Clean code structure with logical comments.
- **Scalable:** Handles large datasets efficiently.
